/**
 * Tailwind CSS v4 does not require a config file for basic usage.
 *
 * This file is intentionally minimal. You can delete it entirely unless you
 * want to add custom theme tokens, sources, or plugins later.
 *
 * To customize Tailwind v4, you might add (examples):
 *
 * export default {
 *   theme: {
 *     extend: {
 *       colors: {
 *         brand: '#6366f1',
 *       },
 *     },
 *   },
 *   plugins: [],
 * };
 *
 * For now, leaving this file present but empty (aside from this comment)
 * prevents tooling that auto-detects Tailwind config files from erroring.
