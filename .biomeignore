# .biomeignore
#
# This file provides explicit per-path ignores for Biome’s formatter & linter.
# Many of these are also covered by the "files.ignore" section in biome.json;
# keeping them here makes local experimentation (temporarily commenting things out)
# easier without editing the main config.
#
# Patterns follow .gitignore-style globbing.
